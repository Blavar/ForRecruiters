Well well well

First of all, thanks for taking a look here. Given I have no formal education/courses/certificates in the field,
showcasing some things I've been working on through GitHub is my only shot at proving that I'm onto something.

Just a heads up: many of these programs are either unfinished, or left finished in a state, 
in which they'd probably rather be 'finished'. That's becuase I tried to keep the feel 
of the projects as 'workshopy' and 'informal', if you can call it that. Also, most of them
were done in the span of 3-4 weeks of vigorous learning and implementing new-found concepts
from AI. Admittedly, one might consider the general lack of corporate-grade polish in something
pretending to be a portfolio, to not be a good look. Sue me.

The files are decorated with very verbose comments full of snarky remarks and arcane references, on occasion actually
explaining what's being done and why. I of course don't expect You to read EVERYTHING. I certainly didn't.
The reason for the abovementioned verbosity was to give a sneak peek into my way of thinking
and solving problems, of overcoming problems within problems in real time, but also to show
that I more or less know what I'm doing. And if I don't: I pretend that I do until
eventually coming up with a nice idea for a solution.

Some of the remarks might seem redundant or even trivial, but again, I decided to trade
brevity for more insight into how I do things. I You ever feel like dozing off,
You might just skip a bit, after all.

BUT, I think it's time for you to, preferably, pull the repo and start chewing into
this... portofolio. Sit down, relax, and pretend that You're watching
a cartoon episode. Enjoy.

SIDENOTE: One last thing. If I may. Even though as I mentioned, I have no formal training, 
courses, certificates, and so on, and so on *sniff* I've been quite busy.
I've started a learning grind in may this year and been going strong since then.
For what it's worth, here are some of the resources I've devoured/am in the middle of devouring:
