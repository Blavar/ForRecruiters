'''
I was playing around with a small framework (if you can call it that) for visualizing tree-like structures,
as apparently they tend to come up a lot in problems I tackle, and, You won't believe this,
but actually seeing if the structure behaves properly is a game changer. Must be why data visualization is a thing.

The main idea is pretty simple: given a tree structure consisting of node-like objects,
wrap each one in an Elem object (name borrowed from JS) - a graphical representation of the graph.
Elems can compute their position and siz recursively by parasiting on the node's properties

You'll also notice that the above paragraph is demonstrably lying, because in this implementation:
(1) a tree generating class is generating Elems from the get go, not Nodes,
(2) because of (1), Elems inherit from Node and invoke its' constructor

I couldn't be bothered right now though. By the time of You, Dear Reader, reading this, I got neural networks to train
